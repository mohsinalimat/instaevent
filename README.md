# instaevent
This is a complete, (quite) working project i developed for a client in the last 4 months.
It features push notifications via OneSignal, Firebase DB, MVVC, Swift 3
It allows one registered user to direct send an event to another registered user (if the phone number is 
present in the address book)
Event Managing with Searching is also ok.

There's still huge room for improvements. Feel free to fork and make it better.
